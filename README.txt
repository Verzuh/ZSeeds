ZSeeds is a mod for Minecraft developed in Java.

It adds the ability to plant and grow zombies from loot that can be collected from a normal zombie.
When you have a zombie crop, you can also place other types of blocks around the crop to give a mutation chance to the crop.
This will allow the full grown zombie to be of a new mutated type such as a wood zombie or an iron zombie.
These new mutated zombies can be replanted to go for a new mutation or can be farmed to collect the specific resource that they drop.
