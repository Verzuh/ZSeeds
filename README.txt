How to export mod.

Now open a command window and navigate to the folder. (On windows you can also use shift-rightclick->open powershell here).
In the command window use the following command: gradlew.bat build.
Now wait for the command to finish and if everything goes well you shouldnâ€™t get any errors.

Now navigate to FORGEFOLDER/build/libs, in there you will find a jar file named MODID-VERSION.jar. You can use this jar file just like you would install other mods.
